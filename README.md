# figma-to-react-workshop

### ⁉️ What are we learning?
We will be learning how to create self-contained reusable components based off of a Figma prototype file!
We will be using Styled Components to create this card! Read more on Styled Components [here](https://styled-components.com/).

### ✍️ Steps to follow along!

  <summary>go to Figma file</summary>
  
  - Figma file link: [https://www.figma.com/file/ZPYG635d4BFyQJI4nGDhHS/Figma-to-React-Workshop?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/ZPYG635d4BFyQJI4nGDhHS/Figma-to-React-Workshop?node-id=0%3A1)
    - navigate to the Inspect tab for CSS code (on the upper right hand corner of the screen)
      * don’t rely on the CSS Figma generates
      * should not be taking the code used to generate the position of the component on the page
      * only use the CSS generated for styling the component like border radius, color, font etc.
